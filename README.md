# cic2020interns_wk3 - Implementing COVID-19 API
## Java Mini-Challenge
https://api.covid19api.com/

## Scenario
You are a recently hired full stack developer given the task of completing an API development user story started by a former colleague. You must complete the requirements of the user story and test to ensure all new and existing funtionality of the API.

## User Story 
 > As a React Native COVID-19 mobile developer, I want to use an API that I can receive a list of countries where I have provided the countries and whether they are compared by "Total Confirmed", "Total Deaths", or "Total Recovered" so that I can display the list in the mobile application.

### Sample UI
![Sample User Interface](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/203313/files/8ecc4a00-bb67-11ea-944a-17d4b83d1486)

### Developer's Notes
> "Hey, I pretty much finished everything except the comparison API. Pretty easy and I already created the payload. You just need to implement the **getComparison** method in **Covid19ApiServiceImpl** to return a the list of countries sorted by the CompareBy enum."

> "Oh yeah, I left my Postman collection for you to use."

> "Good luck! J!"
